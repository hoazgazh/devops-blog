## Sample Question

### Q: A project has two AWS accounts, a development account and a production account, in the us-east-1 Region. A DevOps engineer has to deploy artifacts from the development account's S3 bucket to the production account's S3 bucket using AWS CodePipeline with Amazon S3 deploy action. What configurations are mandatory for this cross-account deployment? (Select two)

```basic
**Giải thích (Vietnamese):**  
Để triển khai cross-account, bạn cần phải đảm bảo rằng bucket ở tài khoản production cho phép IAM role từ tài khoản development thực hiện PutObject. Đồng thời, IAM role ở tài khoản development phải có đủ quyền truy cập tới cả hai bucket và có thể assume role trong tài khoản production. Điều này đảm bảo an toàn và quản lý truy cập hiệu quả giữa các tài khoản.
```
